# EduEase: AI-Powered Learning from Video ðŸ§ âœ¨

EduEase is a web application designed to make learning from online videos easier and more effective, especially for students with cognitive differences like ADHD. It transforms any YouTube educational video into a clear, structured, and interactive study guide.

## The Problem EduEase Solves

Watching long educational videos can be a challenge. It's easy to get distracted, miss key points, and passively consume information without retaining it. This is a significant barrier for neurodivergent learners. EduEase tackles this by converting passive video content into an **active, engaging, and digestible learning experience**, reducing cognitive load and dramatically improving retention.
